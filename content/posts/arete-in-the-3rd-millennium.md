A society that values the appearance of skill over the journey of mastery is fundamentally broken. We're building a world of people who want the trophy without the game and who think clicking buttons equals craftsmanship. You can't outsource arete. Period. That's the whole point. Excellence comes through struggle, not delegation. When you skip the painful parts, you skip the transformation.


This creates people incapable of death.


I mean this literally. The death of the ego. The death of limitation. The death of who you were before mastery reshaped you. These small deaths are the essence of growth, each one a necessary surrender that makes space for rebirth. Machines exist entirely outside this cycle. They generate without dying to themselves. They produce without transformation.


Look at the eyes of someone who's mastered something difficult. There's a quality there you'll never find in someone who's only pressed buttons. It's the look of someone who has died a thousand small deaths and returned stronger each time. Someone who has surrendered to the process, been humbled by it, and emerged on the other side fundamentally different.


The machine knows nothing of this death. It cannot surrender because it has no self to give up. It cannot be humbled because it has no pride to overcome. It cannot be reborn because it was never truly alive. And so its outputs, however perfect, remain sterile as its divorced from the cycle that gives human creation its depth and resonance.


A society that encourages people to bypass this cycle creates spiritual zombies who are techincally alive, but untouched by the transformative power of struggle and surrender. People who accumulate achievements without accumulating wisdom. People who move through life without being moved by it.


So what do we do, those of us who can still recognize what's being lost? How do we live among the zombies without becoming one ourselves?


First, practice deliberate inefficiency. Choose at least one domain where you refuse automation no matter how convenient. One area where you insist on the full, messy, inefficient experience of learning through struggle. Cook without recipes. Build without instructions. Write with your hand instead of prompting. The specific domain matters less than your commitment to the transformative friction it provides.

Second, seek out other practitioners of the old ways. These relationships become refuges in a world increasingly hostile to genuine mastery. They're the ones who'll see and honor your transformations, who'll recognize the deaths you've endured to reach your rebirth.


Third, develop discernment between tools that augment human capability and systems that replace human becoming. There's nothing inherently noble about rejecting technology, but the question is whether a technology expands your capacity for transformation or eliminates it. A chisel is not a 3D printer. A calculator is not an AI that solves the problem for you. Learn to recognize the difference.


Fourth, honor the masters in your midst, especially those whose crafts have been most aggressively automated. The baker whose hands know the dough in ways no machine ever will. The musician who has died into their instrument. The craftsperson who has surrendered to their materials. These people aren't just preserving skills; they're preserving a way of being human that our society desperately needs.


Finally, accept that this path makes you an outsider in your own time. The zombies will outproduce you. They'll accumulate credentials faster. They'll generate more content with less effort. Let them. The metrics by which they measure success have nothing to do with the transformation you're seeking. That is truly what arete is.


This isn't about nostalgia or rejecting progress. It's about maintaining your capacity for death and rebirth in a world increasingly designed to help you avoid both. It's about recognizing that what makes us human isn't just what we can produce, but how producing it transforms us.


The machines will continue to evolve. The zombies will continue to multiply. But as long as some of us remember what it means to die into our craft, to surrender, to be humbled, to be transformed, something essential about being human remains alive. Not as a relic of the past, but as the seed of a more authentic future. Don't escape samsara, embrace it.
