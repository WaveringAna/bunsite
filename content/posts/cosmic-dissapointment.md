# The Cosmic Disappointment

For decades, we've dreamed of exploring alien worlds, commanding starships through the void, and experiencing the majesty of the cosmos through interactive entertainment. Space represents the ultimate sandbox, infinite possibilities stretching across unfathomable distances. Yet time and again, games set among the stars fail to capture the wonder and excitement their settings promise.

I'm not just being cynical here. I've sunk hundreds of hours into No Man's Sky, waiting for that promised sense of discovery to materialize. Sure, the first few planets feel magical. Alien landscapes with bizarre creatures set against impossible skies should feel magical. But by the twentieth world? The fiftieth? You start seeing the same parts reshuffled like cosmic Mr. Potato Heads. Different colored grass doesn't make a fundamentally different experience.

The game tries to thread an impossible needle: making emptiness entertaining. Space is, by definition, mostly nothing, vast stretches of nothing punctuated by occasional somethings. That's fascinating in concept but mind-numbing as gameplay. After a while, No Man's Sky feels less like exploration and more like collecting different colored versions of the same five resources to fuel your journey to collect more differently colored versions of those same resources.

Starfield just hammered this lesson home again. Bethesda promised 1,000+ planets and delivered exactly that, technically. What they didn't mention was that you'd see everything the game had to offer within the first three. I spent more time in inventory management screens than I did feeling any sense of cosmic wonder. After ten hours, I realized I was playing Fallout 4 with a space skin but with more loading screens and less interesting environments.

Even when developers try a more curated approach, something essential gets lost. The Outer Worlds gave us handful of carefully designed planets instead of procedural infinity, but they felt like movie sets. Pretty facades with invisible walls everywhere. It's good at being an RPG but completely fails at making me feel like an explorer. Everything I "discover" has been deliberately placed there like finding Easter eggs in your own living room.

This problem extends to live service games too. I've dumped over 3,000 hours into Destiny 2 (a fact I'm not sure whether to brag about or apologize for), and its gorgeous planetary destinations suffer from a fatal flaw: there's nothing to actually DO in them. Europa looks stunning with its blue ice caves and broken Braytech facilities, but after the campaign, it's just a pretty backdrop for the same repeatable activities you do everywhere else.

The gorgeous cyberpunk cityscape of Neomuna? I spent a week there before it devolved into another checkbox on my weekly to-do list. Beautiful but utterly hollow, a cosmic treadmill with a pretty view.

It's telling that the games that actually succeed at creating compelling space experiences are those that don't try to simulate the entirety of space at all. Stellaris works because it presents space as information rather than direct experience. When my science ship discovers "crystalline entities orbiting a pulsar," my imagination creates something far more alien and interesting than any graphics engine could render.

Mass Effect never pretends to offer freedom of exploration. Its galaxy map is just a fancy menu, but it works because it connects handcrafted content focused on characters and conflict. The Normandy feels more like a real spaceship than any vessel I've piloted in No Man's Sky, precisely because the game doesn't waste resources trying to simulate the empty void between destinations.

The sad truth might be that space itself just isn't that interesting as a gameplay environment. The original Halo trilogy created more memorable sci-fi by keeping players firmly on the ground in focused combat environments. Half-Life's Black Mesa research facility delivered more compelling science fiction than countless games with quintillions of planets. Portal's confined test chambers provided more wonder than the entirety of Starfield's galaxy. (Poral's level design deserves its own article)

Writers figured this out long ago. When Frank Herbert describes Arrakis, he doesn't catalog every sand dune, he shows us the parts that matter to the story and leaves the rest to our imagination. Games can't easily do this without feeling artificial. If you give me a spaceship, I naturally want to go anywhere and explore everything. But that creates an impossible expectation no developer can fulfill.

And so the cycle continues: a new developer announces they've cracked the code of space gaming; trailers show seamless planetary exploration and endless possibilities; the game launches to initial awe; then players slowly realize they're experiencing the same fundamental disappointment with a fresh coat of paint.

I'll still buy the next big space game. I'll still hope. But I'm starting to think that space, vast, empty, and mysterious, might be the one frontier games can never truly conquer.
