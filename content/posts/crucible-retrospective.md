title: 3000 hours of Destiny 2 PvP.
excerpt: Maybe that’s the real reason I’m still here. Not because I think it’ll get better, or because I’m chasing some lost feeling. I’m here because, for all its problems, Destiny 2 PvP is still the only place where the gunfights, the movement, and the chaos come together in a way that feels right—even when everything else is wrong.

My first shooters were Quake 3, Quake 4, Team Fortress 2, Halo, and a little bit of CoD. Back then, the average time to kill was over a second, no matter your skill bracket. That’s gone now. Modern shooters have gutted that pacing. Battle Royales try to bring it back, but those games are a coin flip. That’s why I keep coming back to the Crucible in Destiny 2. It’s a mess. Loose skill-based matchmaking that pleases no one and favors neither skill nor connection, supers that turn the last three minutes into a clown show, weapons that hand out headshots for body shots, and a netcode that can’t decide if it wants to be fair or just funny. But the gunplay, the movement, and the time to kill on primaries keep me hooked.

People always say Destiny’s PvP is unique because of buildcrafting or the “space magic.” Those are the worst parts of the sandbox, both to play with and against. What draws me in is the movement and gun feel. Destiny’s movement isn’t as tight as Quake, but it’s fast and expressive. The primaries have just enough lethality to reward tracking and positioning, but not so much that you die before you can react. You can chain a primary kill into a special weapon play, and that rhythm is quite addictive.

Halo Infinite almost got it right, but then 343 gave mouse and keyboard the same crosshair magnetism as controller. It feels wrong. It’s not satisfying, and frankly, maddening to play with (and seriously, if you want to whine about input methods that you lose to instead of using that time to get better, you are a bad player). Destiny’s aim assist is bad, but at least it’s honest about it. Maybe I’m just chasing the feeling these games used to give me, knowing it’s never coming back, in the same way a LoL player is stuck remembering when the game was only Garen vs Darius top lane as a [Gwen kills a 4248 HP Sett in 3 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABk8rIibc-0).

I feel no [scrub mentality](https://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win). I know what’s good, I use it, and I move on. That’s what good players do. I’m not here to prove a point or play a different game than everyone else. I’m here because, for all its flaws, Destiny 2’s PvP gives me something I can’t get anywhere else.

Let’s be clear: Destiny 2 PvP is not a good product. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of half-finished ideas, balance passes that never land, and a player base bled dry by years of neglect. The best maps are from the first year of release. The best weapons are either bugged, have Aim Assistance Stats of over 80, or nerfed into irrelevance. Every patch is a dice roll. Sometimes you get a meta that rewards gun skill and movement. Sometimes you get a meta that rewards hiding behind a barricade and spamming abilities. The developers can’t decide if they want a shooter or a MOBA, so we get the worst of both.

And yet, nothing else feels quite like it. The movement is floaty, but you can outplay people with positioning and timing. The gunfights are inconsistent, but when you land a perfect three-tap or shotgun someone mid-slide, it’s satisfying in a way no other game matches. Even the frustration is addictive. Every time I get killed by a laggy shotgun ape or a Warlock blinking out of reality, I want to uninstall. But I queue up again, because the next game might be different. The next game might be the one where everything clicks.

I don’t play Destiny 2 PvP because it’s good. I play it because it’s the only thing left that scratches this particular itch. I’ve tried everything else. Apex, Valorant, Halo Infinite, even going back to Quake Live. They all miss something. Destiny 2 is a disaster, but it’s a disaster I understand. After 3000 hours, I know every flaw, every exploit, every broken interaction. I know what’s coming, and I keep playing anyway.

Maybe that’s the real reason I’m still here. Not because I think it’ll get better, or because I’m chasing some lost feeling. I’m here because, for all its problems, Destiny 2 PvP is still the only place where the gunfights, the movement, and the chaos come together in a way that feels right—even when everything else is wrong. I’ve put in 3000 hours. I know exactly what I’m getting. And for now, that’s enough. I hope Marathon can be a good home for me, but Bungie has had over 10 years with Destiny, and thats track record enough.
