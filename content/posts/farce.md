title: The Farce of Modern Rome
excerpt: The Republic ended. The Empire that replaced it is already dying. And the citizens-turned-subjects watch the farce continue, some cheering, some numb, most simply trying to survive, all of them participants in a charade that everyone knows has already reached its conclusion but that no one possesses the courage to acknowledge has ended.

The marble columns of Rome gleamed under a sun that had witnessed too much, their polished surfaces reflecting a city that had traded its Republic for the gilded cage of Empire. In the shadow of these monuments to stolen glory, the Senate still gathered and debated. Passed decrees—but all with the hollow pretense of a theater troupe performing a play whose ending had long been decided. Augustus had masterfully cloaked his autocracy in the vestments of Republican tradition, and his successors, with varying degrees of subtlety, continued this charade as the Empire's foundations began to crumble. 

The Roman populace, once citizens of a proud Republic, had been reduced to a dependant mob, pacified with bread and circuses while their wealth was systematically extracted to fund an ever-expanding bureaucracy and military machine. The Praetorian Guard, once protectors of the state, had become kingmakers and executioners, their loyalty for sale to the highest bidder. Taxes mounted as inflation debased the currency, yet officials proclaimed each new levy a necessity for security, each new deprivation a sacrifice for the common good. The state's propaganda machine worked tirelessly, transforming humiliation into victory, scarcity into abundance, and fear into patriotism. 

In the forums and bathhouses, whispers of the old Republic lingered like ghosts, quickly silenced by the watchful eyes of informants. The great families that had once wielded real power now curried favor at the imperial court, their ancestral dignity traded for proximity to power. Meanwhile, the provinces bled, their resources funneled toward the capital to sustain the illusion of prosperity. The Empire became a vast apparatus of extraction and control, its purpose no longer the well-being of its people but the perpetuation of its own bloated existence. Rome had become a corpse that still believed itself alive, its citizens both victims and accomplices in a farce of their own making.

The echos are alive for sure, yet not. The *Princeps Civitatis* has none of the vigor. None of the fear. Rome is dying and taking the world order with it yet again, but disgracefully. We see an autocrat wielding power because he is fearful of his own citizens. He won't even create the red velvet lie of 'protecting the heartland' like many Civitai before him.

But to frame this as merely the failure of one man—one weak, fearful, incompetent *Princeps*—is to mistake symptom for disease. The power he wields was not seized. It was left unguarded, abandoned by the very institutions meant to jealously protect it, lying in the forum like a discarded weapon that anyone with sufficient ambition and shamelessness could simply pick up.

The Senate still convenes. The power of the purse—that most sacred check, the one restraint the founders of the Republic believed could never be surrendered—was not wrested from their hands. They opened their palms and let it fall. For decades before this *Princeps*, they had been abdicating through continuing resolutions that governed by inertia rather than deliberation, through omnibus bills so sprawling that no senator could claim to have read them, through the quiet acceptance that executives could simply refuse to spend appropriated funds and face no real consequence. The *Princeps* simply declares what funds he will release and what he will withhold. Money appropriated by the Senate flows to loyal provinces, while recalcitrant territories find their allocations frozen, their disaster relief delayed, their infrastructure projects mysteriously stalled. But he does this because they taught him he could—through years of looking away, of avoiding hard votes, of preferring executive action because it freed them from accountability.

Emergency declarations pile atop one another like sedimentary layers, each granting extraordinary powers that somehow never expire, until "emergency" has become the permanent condition of imperial rule. When senators object, they discover that objection without enforcement is merely performance, and enforcement would require them to admit that the Republic ended years ago while they were still applauding. They discover that they prefer the theater of opposition to the risk of actually wielding power. Better to let the *Princeps* act and then condemn him, than to exercise their constitutional authority and face voters' judgment for the result.

The war powers went even more quietly, surrendered not in a single dramatic moment but through the slow erosion of decades. The legions had been deploying without senatorial authorization since the wars in distant eastern provinces generations ago. The Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed in the panic after barbarians struck the capital, simply codified what had already become practice—that the *Princeps* could wage war wherever and however he pleased, and the Senate's constitutional authority was a formality to be observed in times of political convenience and ignored in times of executive will. The *Princeps* commands, client states are threatened, alliances dissolved, strikes ordered against enemies who may or may not actually threaten Rome. The Senate occasionally stages debates about reclaiming its constitutional authority over war and peace, then quietly tables the measures, afraid to learn what would happen if they passed a resolution the *Princeps* simply ignored. But their fear is not of his strength—it is of their own impotence, finally made explicit.

The Praetorian Guard sits in its marble temple, nine figures in robes who were meant to protect the constitutional order but have instead become its most effective destroyers. They did not wake one morning and decide to betray their mandate. They have been building toward this for generations, through legal theories incubated in partisan academies, through careful appointments by executives who understood that the Guard could be turned from shield to sword. They have granted the *Princeps* immunity so sweeping it would have embarrassed Caligula. They have blessed his emergency powers, his rewriting of laws through executive decree, his transformation of the bureaucracy into a personal instrument. They wrap each capitulation in the language of judicial restraint and original intent, calling constitutional surrender "deference" and calling the death of checks and balances "textualism." When the *Princeps* violates even their generous interpretations, they simply refuse to hear the case, letting his actions stand through silence rather than through the embarrassment of explicit approval.

But here is where theory collides with the brute fact of individual agency: none of this structural rot, none of this institutional abdication, none of this decades-long erosion of republican checks explains why *this* *Princeps* wields power with such disgraceful incompetence, such transparent malice, such pathetic fear. 

Where Augustus at least possessed the competence to make autocracy functional, where even the weaker Julio-Claudians maintained some pretense of serving Rome's glory, this *Princeps* cannot even muster the energy for a convincing fiction. The institutions left power lying on the floor, yes—but they did not dictate what he would do once he picked it up. He could have, in theory, used unchecked executive authority to build infrastructure, to reform administration, to create a system that, however unjust in its concentration of power, at least functioned toward some coherent end.

Instead: The tariffs are impulsive, contradictory, imposed and lifted based on which foreign leader paid proper tribute at his resort. The deportations are theatrical cruelty, performed not for any coherent policy goal but as spectacle for the mob. The prosecutions of rivals are announced on the forums—the social media platforms that have replaced the bathhouses—before charges have even been formulated, transparently vindictive, almost comically petty.

The institutions made autocracy possible. But the *Princeps* made it disgraceful.

He rules from fear. Not the population's fear of him, though he cultivates that through the security apparatus and the Praetorian Guard. No—his fear of them. The structural weakness of institutions explains why he could accumulate power. It does not explain why he wields it from behind barricades of executive orders and emergency powers, why he demands oaths of personal fealty from prosecutors and generals, why he lashes out at the slightest criticism, the smallest demonstration in the provinces, any suggestion that his authority might be questioned. 

This is not strategic consolidation. This is not the calculated autocracy of a leader who understands that unchecked power requires at least the performance of serving the state. This is a man who cannot distinguish between the state and himself, who accumulated absolute authority because the institutions abandoned their posts, and who now uses that authority for nothing except self-preservation, petty vengeance, and the inflation of his own ego.

Both realities exist simultaneously, each making the other worse. The institutions created the vacuum. The man filled it with poison. The Senate's abdication made autocracy inevitable. The *Princeps's* pathology made it uniquely destructive and absurd. Rome did not require this particular kind of disgrace—a *Princeps* who golfs while the state collapses, who cannot articulate a vision beyond his own survival, who rules through incoherent tantrums and culture war obsessions. But the institutions' surrender ensured that when such a man arrived, nothing could stop him.

And meanwhile, the old Roman dream—that fiction of universal citizenship, of being Roman first and provincial second—has rotted away entirely. Though perhaps "rotted" suggests something once healthy that decayed. The truth is uglier: it was always a lie. Rome spoke of citizenship and law while building its wealth on slavery, while denying personhood to the majority of those who lived within its borders, while reserving the full rights of citizenship for a narrow class defined by birth and blood. The high rhetoric of the Republic coexisted with the mundane reality of human beings as property, of entire populations excluded from the civic body they were forced to sustain through their labor.

So too with this Rome. The dream of universal citizenship, of equality before the law, of being Roman first and provincial second—this was proclaimed while millions labored in bondage, while the law itself encoded their status as property, while citizenship was explicitly restricted by race. The beautiful rhetoric and the brutal reality existed simultaneously, neither negating the other in the minds of those who benefited from the contradiction. The lie was not a betrayal of founding principles. The lie *was* the founding principle—that freedom and slavery, equality and hierarchy, citizenship and subjugation could coexist as long as the hierarchy was maintained, as long as everyone understood which Romans were really Roman.

What has rotted away is not the universal dream—that never existed—but rather the precarious expansion of that dream to include those it was originally designed to exclude. For a brief historical moment, through blood and struggle, some of the excluded forced their way into citizenship, made the lie slightly less sweeping. That expansion is now contracting. The old hierarchy reasserts itself, the original vision of restricted citizenship returns, and those who benefited from the lie's partial dismantling discover it was only ever a temporary accommodation, a concession that could be revoked once the balance of power shifted.

Here too, both structural and individual forces compound. The economic extraction from provinces to capital, the concentration of power in the imperial center, the transformation of citizens into dependents—these are structural outcomes of imperial systems, observable across centuries and civilizations. But the *Princeps* has taken these structural tendencies and weaponized them through deliberate cruelty and explicit hierarchy.

Those in the capital and its surrounding territories have declared themselves the true Romans, the real citizens. The others, the ones from the wrong provinces, who speak the wrong languages, who worship the wrong gods, whose skin marks them as insufficiently Roman—they are subjects now, their loyalty perpetually suspect, their rights contingent on proper demonstrations of submission to the imperial center. The *Princeps* did not create the conditions for this tribal regression. But he has made it explicit, celebrated it, turned it from implicit bias into explicit policy.

The provinces that once believed themselves equal partners in the Republic now exist only to be extracted from. Their resources flow toward the capital while the *Princeps* vilifies them as disloyal, threatens to withhold disaster relief, sends the legions to enforce compliance. The structural incentives of empire explain the extraction. They do not explain the vindictive glee with which this *Princeps* punishes disfavored territories, the personal spite he brings to the systematic looting.

The great merchant families—those who control the grain supply and the shipping lanes and the new technologies—prostrate themselves at the imperial court. Their fortunes depend not on commerce or innovation but on the *Princeps's* favor, which can be granted or revoked with a single post in the forums. This is the predictable outcome of any system where state power and economic power fuse. But the arbitrary, capricious nature of this *Princeps's* favor-granting—the way fortunes rise and fall based on personal flattery rather than even corrupt but comprehensible exchange of benefits—this is particular to the man, not the structure.

The bread and circuses continue, though now the bread comes as targeted subsidies and tax relief for the loyal territories, carefully withheld from the suspect ones. The circuses are culture war spectacles, manufactured enemies, an endless parade of internal threats to justify the security state's expansion. The mob cheers as the *Princeps* promises to purge the disloyal from the bureaucracy, to root out the hidden enemies, to restore Rome to its former glory—though no one can quite articulate when that golden age occurred or what it looked like.

In the forums, whispers of the old Republic persist. Remember when the Senate held the purse? Remember when only the Senate could declare war? Remember when the Praetorian Guard checked executive power instead of blessing it? Remember when we were citizens instead of subjects, when being Roman meant something more than demonstrating proper tribal loyalty? But these whispers grow more dangerous by the day. Each agency has become a miniature surveillance apparatus. Each loyalist a potential informant. The smart Romans have learned to perform enthusiasm for the imperial project while carefully avoiding any topic that might reveal insufficient devotion.

Rome staggers on, a machine of extraction and control that serves no purpose except its own perpetuation. The structure is self-sustaining—empires do not require competent emperors to continue grinding their populations into dust. But this *Princeps* manages to make even the grinding gratuitous, adding layers of cruelty and chaos that serve no structural function, that advance no imperial interest, that exist purely as expressions of personal pathology amplified to the scale of state power.

He grows older and more paranoid, unable to imagine succession because he cannot distinguish between the state and himself. The Senate performs its constitutional duties while everyone understands they mean nothing. The Praetorian Guard issues rulings that would have been unthinkable a generation ago, and the next generation will inherit even more concentrated power, even fewer functional checks, even less memory of what the Republic was supposed to be.

The world order that Rome built and sustained—the network of alliances and treaties and international norms—crumbles as the *Princeps* treats allies with contempt and enemies with incoherent inconsistency. Client states that once looked to Rome for protection now hedge their bets with rival powers. The barbarians watch and wait and test the frontiers, probing for weakness, finding it everywhere. Here again: structural imperial overextension would have caused this decline eventually. But this *Princeps* has accelerated it through incompetence and spite, burning alliances for no strategic purpose, alienating client states through personal insult rather than calculated interest.

Rome is taking the world down with it, but this time without even the dignity of a coherent vision or a worthy opponent. Just decay. Just exhaustion. Just a frightened autocrat wielding absolute power from behind the walls of a state apparatus he's too paranoid to leave and too incompetent to effectively wield, enabled by institutions that surrendered their authority long before he arrived to claim it.

And now, as if to crystallize both failures into a single perfect image, the government has simply stopped functioning. The Treasury cannot pay its bills. The grain administrators are furloughed. The aqueduct inspectors sit idle. The border garrison payroll is frozen. Rome, the eternal city, the center of the world, cannot perform the basic administrative functions that even a moderately competent provincial governor manages without incident.

The structural critique observes: this shutdown is possible only because the Senate spent decades accepting that appropriations were suggestions rather than commands, because they built a system where executive signing was a veto point rather than a formality, because they preferred to avoid hard votes and let the executive absorb political blame for governance.

The individual critique observes: the *Princeps* is at his coastal villa. Golfing. Hosting banquets. Posting in the forums about how this paralysis is entirely the Senate's fault—they refused to appropriate funds for his pet projects, you see, they obstructed his vision for Rome's glory. But also, in the very next breath, he celebrates the shutdown. Those furloughed administrators? They were disloyal anyway. Provincial appointments, most of them. Probably engaged in all sorts of degenerate practices, promoting foreign cults, undermining traditional Roman values with their obsession with exotic eastern religions and their tolerance for deviant behavior. 

"Transgender for everybody," he says without a flinch, absurdity of the statement ringing no bells. 

Better that they're sent home, he thinks. A purge by paralysis.

The institutions created the possibility space for this shutdown. The man filled that space with incoherent vindictiveness. The Senate's abdication explains why he can let Rome grind to a halt without consequence. It does not explain why he does so while simultaneously blaming others and celebrating the chaos, why he cannot articulate a coherent position, why he rules from a villa fixated on culture war phantoms while the state he controls literally cannot pay its employees.

The contradiction doesn't register with him, or perhaps it does and he simply doesn't care. The Senate won't give him money, which is their fault, but also he's glad government workers aren't being paid because they're his enemies anyway. Rome is grinding to a halt, and the *Princeps* cannot decide whether this is a crisis he blames on his opponents or a victory he claims as his own. So he does both, sometimes in the same declaration, secure in the knowledge that the mob will simply accept whichever frame suits their prejudices.

The senators watch this unfold with the hollow-eyed exhaustion of men who have long since stopped believing their votes matter. Some make speeches about fiscal responsibility and constitutional duty. Others rush to the forums to praise the *Princeps's* strength and wisdom. All of them know the truth: the government will restart when the *Princeps* decides it will restart, not a moment before, and their appropriations and authorizations are just set dressing for a decision that will be made at the villa between rounds of golf.

But here is the final, cruelest irony: they could, even now, reclaim their power. The constitutional authority still exists, dormant but not dead. They could refuse to pass continuing resolutions and force genuine appropriations debates. They could rescind the emergency authorizations. They could impeach and remove. They could use their oversight powers to actually constrain executive action. The structure bent, but it has not yet broken completely.

They will not. Not because the *Princeps* has somehow prevented them, but because doing so would require courage, would risk political consequences, would demand they actually govern rather than perform governance. They prefer the theater. They prefer to blame him while enabling him. They prefer the structural excuses—the system made this inevitable, nothing could be done—to the uncomfortable reality that they are choosing this outcome through daily acts of cowardice.

The Republic ended. The Empire that replaced it is already dying. The institutions surrendered their authority through decades of erosion and abdication, creating the vacuum. The *Princeps* filled that vacuum with grotesque incompetence, transparent malice, and pathetic fear, making the autocracy not merely unjust but absurd. And the citizens-turned-subjects watch the farce continue, some cheering, some numb, most simply trying to survive, all of them participants in a charade that everyone knows has already reached its conclusion but that no one possesses the courage to acknowledge has ended.

Both things are true. The system failed. And the man is evil and stupid. Each made the other worse. Each provides an excuse for not confronting the other. And Rome burns while everyone argues about whether to blame the arsonist or the fire code that was never enforced.
