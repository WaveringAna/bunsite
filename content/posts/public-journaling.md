excerpt: Maybe I'm narcissistic, and this is an outlet that people seem to enjoy.

Common sense says not to tell the internet how you feel. Put the diary under the mattress, lock the latch, practice discretion like it's a virtue. I keep writing anyway—short dispatches to a Bluesky feed of about three hundred people. And I'm happier for it.

The same culture that expects me to boymode offline wants my inner life to do the same. Passing, receding, taking up less space. Public journaling is how I refuse.

Social media inherited the diary but inverted its address. Instead of "Dear Diary," it's "Dear Public"—even when that public is small, familiar, and under extensive state surveillance. I see the same handles every day. I know who favorites joy and who shows up under grief. What matters isn't exposure. It's witness.

There's politics in that witness. The liberal fantasy of a clean border between public and private has always been selectively enforced, and the enforcement falls hardest on bodies like mine. "Keep it to yourself" is never neutral—it's an instruction to protect the comfort of those who prefer not to know. It's just "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" in a different font. Boymode is the same request: make your interiority unavailable at the point of sale, at the bus stop, at the office. 

If the world won't give me a room of my own, I'll make a room anyone can enter. I'll furnish it with sentences and reposts of porn.

Public doesn't mean indiscriminate. I'm not posting confessions to be judged—I'm writing field notes from a life. I describe affect more than biography. Facts of sorrow, not forensic chains of custody. Lifts of joy without tracing precise cause. I delay posts when the feeling's too hot. I swap proper nouns for metaphors. I keep a separate file for sentences that want to be essays instead of dispatches.

The objections always arrive: What about employers? Screenshots? The archive that never dies? 

Here's what I know: The DHS already vacuums up firehoses of posts into its databases. Bluesky's backend makes it even more public than Twitter. The panopticon is real and I'm already in it. So is every trans person trying to exist in public space. We're tracked at the DMV when we change our names, flagged in medical databases when we access care, photographed by cops at protests, logged by border agents, monitored by school administrators. The infrastructure of surveillance doesn't need my Bluesky posts—it's already built into every institution we touch.

I could be murdered walking to my car. I could be murdered for using the wrong bathroom. I could be murdered because someone clocked me and decided my existence was an insult. The threat isn't hypothetical—it's the background radiation of trans life. Staying silent doesn't make me safer. It just makes me smaller.

So yeah, I post. Not because I'm brave. Because I'm already exposed, and at least this way I get to control the narrative. At least this way I build an archive that isn't just medical records and legal name changes. At least this way someone else folding themselves down to fit through the day might see proof that another life is possible.

And then there's happiness, which I refuse to footnote. I am happier when I write publicly. Not performing happiness for an algorithm, but documenting the real thing—the dailiness, the textures, the contradictions. These posts are timestamps that say: I felt despair on a Tuesday, and then I survived it. They're proofs of life. Marks in the direction of a life.

If you grew up with a scarcity of mirrors, you learn to build them out of whatever reflects.

The hazards are real. The techniques exist. "Massive no-no" is how a culture protects itself from alternative arrangements. But the alternative is already here: small, durable publics performing slow maintenance for one another—consoling, delighting, bearing witness. My posts insist I am not reducible to the stealth strategies I use to cross certain rooms. I can choose boymode for survival and still refuse boymode of the mind.

Public journaling isn't a failure of boundaries. It's a redistribution. I draw the line in a place that gives me back my voice. I don't write to be brave. I write to be accurate. And accuracy, for me, requires witnesses.

Maybe I'm narcissistic too. But people seem to enjoy my rambling.
