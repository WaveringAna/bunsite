Common sense says not to tell the internet how you feel. Common sense wants me to put the diary under the mattress, lock the latch, and practice discretion as if it were a virtue. But I keep writing anyway. Short dispatches into a Bluesky feed of about three hundred people, and well, I’m fucking happier for it. The same culture that demands I boymode offline expects my inner life to do the same. passing, receding, taking up less space. Public journaling is how I refuse.

Diaries have always been technologies via paper and lock, date and margin, and the ritual of returning to the same page. Social media inherited the form but inverted the direction of address. Instead of “Dear Diary,” it’s “Dear Public,” even when that public is small, familiar, legible, and under extensive state surveillance. I can see the same handles every day. I know who favorites joy and who shows up under grief. What matters is not exposure but the witness.

There is a politics in that witness. The liberal fantasy of a neat border between public and private has always been selectively enforced, and the enforcement falls hardest on bodies like mine. “Keep it to yourself” is never neutral but acts as an instruction to protect the comfort of those who prefer not to know. It's no different than "Don't Ask. Don't Tell." Boymode is the offline version of the same request. Make your interiority unavailable at the point of sale, at the bus stop, at the office. If the world won’t give me a room of my own, I’ll make a room that anyone can enter, and I’ll furnish it with sentences and reposts of porn.

Public does not mean indiscriminate. I am not posting confessions to be judged I am writing field notes from a life. I describe affect more than biography with facts of sorrow rather than a forensic chain of custody with a lift of joy rather than precise cause.

The objections always arrive. What about employers? Screenshots? The archive that never dies? Well, I majored in History and Political Science. I thought the latter would protect me from dismal prospects and the debt spiral, but clearly I was wrong, and at this point, I can't care enough.

Bluesky is not the only platform with small publics, but in my slice of it, the proportions are right as it's large enough to avoid claustrophobia, but small enough to keep the grain of attention intact. Context collapse still exists as I can’t post to “only the people who understand” but the regulars make the context reconstructible. I made my pinned post, "I love incest," to hopefully filter down to 'only those who understand.'

And then there’s happiness, which I refuse to footnote. I am happier when I write publicly. The historian in me knows I am also building an archive and not a sanitized scrapbook a biographer might prefer, but a ledger of dailiness, marks in the direction of a life. If you grew up with a scarcity of mirrors, you learn to build them out of whatever reflects. These posts are proofs of life, time stamps that say: I felt despair on a Tuesday, and then I survived it. They are also signals to others who fold themselves down to fit through the day. If my vulnerabilities are legible, maybe someone else’s will feel lawful.

The hazards are real; the techniques are too. I delay a post when the feeling is too hot. I swap proper nouns for metaphors. I keep a separate file for sentences that want to be essays instead of dispatches. And yes, I know the DHS vacuums up firehoses of posts into its databases; Bluesky is even more public than X based on the way its backend works. Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this. But I already live with the knowledge that I could be murdered.

“Massive no-no” is how a culture protects itself from alternative arrangements. But the alternative is already here. Small, durable publics perform slow maintenance for one another: consoling, delighting, bearing witness. My posts insist I am not reducible to the stealth strategies I use to cross certain rooms. I can choose boymode for survival and still refuse boymode of the mind.

The thesis being (Dr. Herman I'll finally take your advice to restate it at the end) public journaling is not a failure of boundaries but a redistribution. I draw the line in a place that gives me back my voice. I don’t write to be brave. I write to be accurate. And accuracy, for me, requires witnesses. Maybe I'm narcissistic too, and this is an outlet that people seem to enjoy.
