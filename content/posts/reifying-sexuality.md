Sexuality is not a timeless, universal fact. It is a social construct, shaped by culture, language, and power relations. It shifts across history and geography, influenced by norms, institutions, and personal circumstances. But, sexual identity labels create a rigid taxonomy of fixed categories out of a fluid, socially mediated phenomenon. The label “asexual” illustrates this tension sharply as it creates a binary and reifies sexuality. The label is good. There is strong function in providing language for experiences that have long been marginalized or pathologized. In a society dominated by compulsory sexuality, where sexual attraction is treated as a marker of normalcy and health, the asexual label disrupts dominant narratives and affirms difference.

Yet the label as a definition of distinct identity places sexuality and asexuality as fixed, naturalized essences. Desire and the absence of desire become innate traits part of a self, rather than a position shaped by social forces, cultural meanings, and personal histories. This reification freezes a dynamic, socially produced process into static categories. It conceals how norms, expectations, and cultural scripts shape experiences of desire and non-desire. It entrenches binaries. Sexual versus asexual, normal versus abnormal. It restricts the spectrum of human experience. it imposes rigid boundaries and closes down possibilities.

Identity politics is necessary. It provides language, recognition, and collective strength to resist an oppressive, cisnormative, heteronormative society. It exposes the violence of compulsory sexuality and the marginalization of those who do not conform. It creates space for solidarity, visibility, and political action. Without identity politics, the experiences of those outside dominant norms remain invisible and unaddressed. But essentialism is a trap embedded within this strategy. Treating identities as fixed essences naturalizes what is socially constructed. It transforms provisional categories into absolute truths. It turns tools for resistance into new forms of confinement. Essentialism masks the social forces that produce identities, presenting them instead as innate facts. It limits the capacity to understand sexuality as fluid, contextual, and changeable.
