Sexuality is not a timeless, universal fact. It is a social construct, shaped by culture, language, and power relations. It shifts across history and geography, influenced by norms, institutions, and personal circumstances. But, sexual identity labels create a rigid taxonomy of fixed categories out of a fluid, socially mediated phenomenon. The label “asexual” illustrates this tension sharply as it creates a binary and reifies sexuality. The label is good. There is strong function in providing language for experiences that have long been marginalized or pathologized. In a society dominated by compulsory sexuality, where sexual attraction is treated as a marker of normalcy and health, the asexual label disrupts dominant narratives and affirms difference.

Yet the label as a definition of distinct identity places sexuality and asexuality as fixed, naturalized essences. Desire and the absence of desire become innate traits part of a self, rather than a position shaped by social forces, cultural meanings, and personal histories. This reification freezes a dynamic, socially produced process into static categories. It conceals how norms, expectations, and cultural scripts shape experiences of desire and non-desire. It entrenches binaries. Sexual versus asexual, normal versus abnormal. It restricts the spectrum of human experience. it imposes rigid boundaries and closes down possibilities.

Identity politics is necessary. It provides language, recognition, and collective strength to resist an oppressive, cisnormative, heteronormative society. It exposes the violence of compulsory sexuality and the marginalization of those who do not conform. It creates space for solidarity, visibility, and political action. Without identity politics, the experiences of those outside dominant norms remain invisible and unaddressed. But essentialism is a trap embedded within this strategy. Treating identities as fixed essences naturalizes what is socially constructed. It transforms provisional categories into absolute truths. It turns tools for resistance into new forms of confinement. Essentialism masks the social forces that produce identities, presenting them instead as innate facts. It limits the capacity to understand sexuality as fluid, contextual, and changeable.

Labels should function as expressions of self-understanding, not clinical diagnoses or fixed categories. They are ways people articulate their experiences in a specific moment, not permanent definitions of who they fundamentally are. When someone identifies as asexual, they express how they currently understand their relationship to desire and attraction, not a declaration of some immutable essence or biological fact. This shift in perspective maintains the political utility of labels while loosening their essentializing grip. It treats them as provisional expressions, fluid articulations that can change as circumstances, understanding, and social contexts evolve. It refuses the clinical gaze that would categorize and diagnose, instead centering personal meaning-making and self-expression.

Such an approach preserves the power of naming without its reifying consequences. It allows people to express their experiences of desire or non-desire without turning those experiences into fixed identities. It creates space for solidarity without demanding permanence. It acknowledges that how we understand ourselves today may differ from how we understand ourselves tomorrow, and that this fluidity is not a failure but a feature of human experience. Seeing labels as expressions rather than diagnoses also disrupts hierarchies of expertise. It places authority in lived experience rather than clinical or scientific classification. It respects how people make sense of their lives without subjecting those understandings to external validation or medicalization. It treats self-knowledge as legitimate and valuable, even as it recognizes that self-knowledge is itself socially mediated and contextual.

The goal is not to abandon language but to hold it lightly. To use labels as tools for expression without allowing them to harden into fixed categories. It means embracing ambiguity, contradiction, and change as natural elements of how humans understand and articulate sexuality. It means refusing both silence and rigid taxonomy, finding instead a middle path of provisional, contextual expression.
