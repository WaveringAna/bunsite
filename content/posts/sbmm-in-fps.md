title: I enjoy SBMM in FPS games as a good player.
excerpt: What lessons the FPS community should take from the FGC
---

I think a proper way for me to start this discussion is for me to say first what I dislike about SBMM (skill based matchmaking), and what I understand to be the most common arguments against SBMM in multiplayer pvp games are. 

* Connection quality and queue times suffer incredibly at the high and low ends of skill.
* Bad implementations are too sensitive to abnormal games and ratchet up/down your MMR too much too often
* or is too rigid leaving you stuck at the same MMR for far too long.

But the most common I see that I just do not sympathize with or understand, "the matches are too sweaty."

## Video games as a hobby and as a platonic pursuit

For me to consider something as a hobby, I feel it needs to involve a pursuit of skill development. The Greeks had a concept known as *arete*: the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of life. This philosophy resonates deeply with me, as I've always found the greatest satisfaction not in mindless entertainment, but in the disciplined pursuit of mastery. Self-improvement isn't just something I do; it's my primary driver in life.

This mindset permeates everything I touch. When I began working in design years ago, I didn't just want to create pretty things, but I wanted to understand the fundamental principles, to iterate and improve with deliberate practice. I'd spend hours analyzing what worked and what didn't, always measuring my progress against my previous self. The same applies to my ongoing journey with drawing. Each sketch brings new challenges, new opportunities to refine technique, to understand form and perspective on a deeper level.

But perhaps nowhere has this pursuit of mastery been more consistent in my life than in first-person shooters. Since I was young, beginning with Halo 2, I've been captivated by the blend of strategy, reflexes, and game sense that FPS games demand. I've played in tournaments, invested thousands of hours across titles, and currently split my time between Destiny 2, Call of Duty, and occasional Fortnite sessions. Games with a mix of matchmaking algorithms to say the least.

## The joy of meaningful competition

What many players view as a negative, "sweaty" matches where everyone is trying their best, is precisely what I find most rewarding. When I face opponents of similar skill, every engagement becomes a genuine test of ability. Each victory feels earned, each defeat instructive. There's a beautiful clarity to knowing that your success or failure stems directly from your performance, not from the luck of matchmaking.

This is where SBMM shines for players with a growth mindset. Playing against similarly skilled opponents creates the perfect environment for deliberate practice. The matches sit in that sweet spot psychologists call the "zone of proximal development"; challenging enough to push your limits but not so overwhelming that you can't learn from the experience.

When I make a tactical adjustment mid-match and it works, I know it worked against competent opponents. When I try a new approach to holding a position and fail, I receive immediate, relevant feedback. This tight feedback loop is the backbone of meaningful skill development in any domain.

## When matchmaking fails: The Destiny 2 example

My relationship with Destiny 2's PvP exemplifies this philosophy perfectly. When the game featured strict SBMM, every match felt like a genuine opportunity to test and refine my abilities. The Crucible was challenging but fair, victories were satisfying, and even losses provided valuable insights. I used to play every single day during Forsaken and Shadowkeep, two years where the MMR matching was the strictest.

Then came the shift away from strict SBMM, and my experience deteriorated rapidly. Suddenly, lobbies became wildly inconsistent. One match, I'd dominate completely racking up kills against opponents who clearly weren't at my skill level. The next, I'd find myself on the receiving end of a one-sided stomping from players far beyond my capabilities.

This inconsistency destroyed what I valued most: the ability to accurately measure my improvement. When I performed well, was it because I'd genuinely improved, or just because matchmaking had placed me against less skilled players? When I struggled, was it revealing actual weaknesses in my gameplay, or just the inevitable result of facing opponents well outside my skill bracket?

The erratic nature of these matches made it impossible to establish that critical feedback loop needed for deliberate practice. Winning stopped feeling rewarding, and losing stopped feeling instructive. The Crucible became less about skill development and more about the luck of the matchmaking draw, a glorified slot machine of opponent quality.

## The Fighting Game Community knows better

What's particularly frustrating is that another competitive gaming community has already solved this problem. The Fighting Game Community (FGC) embraces challenging matches against similarly skilled opponents as the foundation of improvement. They understand that "downloading" your opponent (recognizing patterns and adapting in real-time) is impossible when the skill gap is too wide in either direction.

In the FGC, players actively seek out stronger opponents, but not impossibly stronger ones. They recognize the value of that sweet spot where matches are challenging but winnable with the right adjustments. They celebrate the "level up" moment when a previously difficult matchup becomes manageable through practice and understanding.

The FPS community could learn so much from this mindset. Instead of complaining about "sweaty" matches, we should recognize them as the most valuable learning opportunities, the fastest path to genuine improvement, and ultimately, the most rewarding gaming experiences.

## Activision's Data Confirms It: SBMM Creates Better Games

While my personal experience strongly favors skill-based matchmaking, [Activision's recent research paper](https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf) on the subject provides compelling data that confirms what I've felt all along. Their findings are particularly valuable because they come from actual A/B testing with millions of players across their titles.

When Activision ran their "Deprioritize Skill Test" in Modern Warfare III, the results were striking. With reduced skill consideration in matchmaking:

* Player retention decreased for 90% of the player base, with only the top 10% most skilled players returning at higher rates
* Quit rates increased significantly for 80% of players
* "Blowout" matches (where one team wins by 30+ points) increased across all skill levels
* Kill Per Minute and Score Per Minute decreased dramatically for lower-skilled players

What's particularly fascinating is their explanation of the long-term effects. Even though top-tier players initially benefited from looser skill matching (with higher KPM and SPM), Activision's researchers noted that this advantage would be temporary. As lower-skilled players left the game at accelerated rates, those once-top players would eventually become middle-of-the-pack in the remaining population, ultimately experiencing the same frustrations that drove others away. (Destiny players may have heard this be called Skill Creep before)

This directly mirrors my experience with Destiny 2 when they loosened SBMM. The initial thrill of occasional dominant performances quickly gave way to a deteriorating overall experience as the player population became increasingly skewed toward higher skill.

## The Skill Grouping Philosophy: Finding the Sweet Spot

What the Activision paper makes clear is that they're not trying to create perfectly flat outcomes where skill doesn't matter. Even with their current implementation of skill consideration, higher-skilled players still perform better than lower-skilled players by a significant margin. The goal is simply to reduce the severity of outcomes to create an environment where all players have some agency in matches.

This aligns perfectly with my philosophy of seeking meaningful competition. I don't want games where everyone performs exactly the same regardless of skill, that would remove the incentive to improve. Instead, I want matches where my skill is consistently tested against appropriate challenges, providing that critical feedback loop necessary for improvement.

The research shows that without some degree of skill consideration, matches become wildly inconsistent for the vast majority of players. The data confirms what I've felt intuitively: those "sweaty" matches that some players complain about are actually the most valuable for skill development and long-term enjoyment.

## Team Balance: Where Skill Matching Truly Shines

One aspect of skill-based matchmaking that often goes underappreciated is its role in team balance. As Activision's paper demonstrates, even small skill differences can dramatically impact win rates. Their data shows that if just one 50th percentile player in a lobby is replaced with an 80th percentile player, that team's win probability jumps to over 70%.

The Activision researchers found that balanced teams are critical for player retention and enjoyment. When players experience too many one-sided matches, whether winning or losing, they're more likely to quit both individual games and the title altogether.

## The Greek Ideal in Action: Gaming as Skill Development

This research validates my view of gaming through the lens of *arete*. The data shows that most players, consciously or not, approach games with this mindset. We want to develop our skills, we want meaningful feedback on our performance, and we want to see improvement over time.

When Activision tested tighter skill matching, they found positive impacts for 90% of players, with reduced quit rates and more balanced matches. While they ultimately chose a middle ground to avoid negatively impacting their highest-skilled players, the data clearly shows that most players thrive in environments where their skills are appropriately challenged.

## SBMM Doesn't Belong Everywhere: Context Matters

While I firmly believe in the benefits of skill-based matchmaking for most competitive FPS games, it's important to acknowledge that this system isn't appropriate for every gaming context. The gaming landscape is incredibly diverse, and different experiences call for different design philosophies.

Take Team Fortress 2, for example. TF2 has such extraordinarily deep skill expression across its nine distinct classes that playing in unmatched public lobbies most of the time is genuinely skill-testing and satisfying. There's always something to learn in every match. The game's design naturally creates opportunities for players at various skill levels to contribute meaningfully, even in the same server.

Similarly, Battlefield's massive 128v128 player lobbies inherently contain enough skill diversity that strict SBMM becomes less necessary. The sheer scale of these battles, combined with the variety of roles players can fill (from frontline infantry to vehicle specialists to support), means that players naturally find their niche and impact level. Someone who struggles in direct firefights might excel at providing reconnaissance or healing teammates. The game strikes a balance of being casual enough to enjoy without strict skill matching while still offering depth for those seeking it.

And then there are games that are very "Mario Party" in nature, titles that are built around chaotic fun, randomness, and unpredictable outcomes. For these experiences, implementing SBMM would be missing the point entirely (and I will fully accept Destiny 2 being one of these Mario Party games if Bungie would stop typing things to winning in Trials). When a game's core design incorporates significant random elements or is intentionally balanced to be approachable over competitive, forcing skill-based pairings would only diminish what makes these games special in the first place.

Context matters tremendously when discussing matchmaking systems. A battle royale with 100 players has different needs than a 6v6 tactical shooter. A fighting game with complex mechanics requires different considerations than a casual party game.

What I'm advocating for isn't universal SBMM implementation across all games, but rather thoughtful application of these systems in contexts where they enhance the core experience, particularly in competitive, skill-focused FPS titles where the disparity between player capabilities can create frustrating experiences for the majority of players (which again, Destiny 2 is unplayable with slightly too wide skill disparities).
