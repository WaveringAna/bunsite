# In Defense of SBMM: Why "Sweaty" Matches Make Games Better

As a skilled FPS player who's invested thousands of hours across Destiny 2, Call of Duty, and Fortnite, I have a confession that might be unpopular: I actually *love* skill-based matchmaking. And I think the "SBMM ruins games" crowd is completely missing the point.

## The "Sweaty" Complaint

Let's address the elephant in the room. The most common complaint I hear is that SBMM makes games "too sweaty" - meaning everyone's trying hard and you can't just relax. But isn't that exactly what makes gaming rewarding?

When I face similarly skilled opponents, every gunfight becomes meaningful. Victories feel earned. Defeats teach me something. That tight feedback loop of challenge → adaptation → improvement is what keeps me coming back day after day.

## My Destiny 2 Nightmare

I experienced firsthand what happens without proper SBMM in Destiny 2. During Forsaken and Shadowkeep when SBMM was strict, I played Crucible daily. Each match was challenging but fair.

Then they loosened SBMM, and my experience completely fell apart. Suddenly matches became a coin flip between stomping inexperienced players (boring) or getting demolished by players far beyond my skill level (frustrating). Neither scenario helped me improve.

The inconsistency destroyed what I valued most: the ability to measure my progress. Was I performing well because I'd improved, or just because matchmaking gave me easier opponents? This uncertainty made the game feel pointless.

## The Data Backs This Up

[Activision's own research](https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf) confirms what I've felt all along. When they tested reduced SBMM in Modern Warfare III:

- Player retention decreased for 90% of players
- Only the top 10% most skilled players returned at higher rates
- Quit rates increased significantly 
- One-sided "blowout" matches increased across all skill levels

Even those top players who initially benefited eventually suffered as the player pool shrank and became more competitive. It's not sustainable.

## The Fighting Game Community Gets It

Fighting game players understand this instinctively. They actively seek opponents of similar or slightly higher skill - challenging but winnable matches where they can "download" their opponent's patterns and adapt. They celebrate the moment when a previously difficult matchup becomes manageable through practice.

FPS players who complain about "sweaty" matches are essentially complaining about having to improve. They're rejecting the most rewarding part of competitive gaming.

## SBMM Isn't For Every Game

That said, context matters. Games like Team Fortress 2 with diverse class roles or Battlefield's massive battles naturally create space for various skill levels. And "Mario Party"-style chaotic fun games shouldn't have strict SBMM at all.

But for competitive shooters where skill gaps determine the entire experience? SBMM creates better games for nearly everyone.

## The Bottom Line

When I hear players complain about matches being "too sweaty," what I really hear is: "I want to feel powerful without having to improve." But easy victories over mismatched opponents are hollow.

The most memorable gaming moments come from those close matches, the clutch plays, the comebacks against worthy opponents. That's what SBMM provides, and that's why I'll defend it every time.
