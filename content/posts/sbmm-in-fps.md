title: I enjoy SBMM in FPS games as a good player.

I'll say what needs to be said: players who complain about "sweaty" matches are afraid of the mirror. They're running from the truth that real growth only happens at the edge of your ability.


When I face players of equal skill, something fundamentally different happens. Each engagement becomes a conversation. Each defeat reveals something about myself I couldn't see before. This tight feedback loop of challenge, failure, and adaptation isn't just how you improve, but it's the entire point of competitive gaming.


The hatred of SBMM reveals our collective weakness. We've built a culture that celebrates hollow victories over mismatched opponents. We've convinced ourselves that "fun" means dominating those who never had a chance. This isn't just bad game design it's a spiritual sickness.


I experienced this firsthand in Destiny 2. During the SBMM era, Crucible was alive. Matches felt like genuine tests of skill rather than random accidents of matchmaking. Then they loosened the algorithm, and the soul of competition died. Matches became coin flips between pointless stomps and helpless defeats. Neither scenario created meaning or growth.


What disappeared wasn't just balance, but the ability to measure my own progress. Was I performing well because I'd improved, or just because the algorithm handed me easier opponents? This uncertainty hollowed out what I valued most: the honest feedback that only comes from facing your equals.


The fighting game community understands what FPS players refuse to see. They seek worthy opponents not despite the challenge but because of it. They celebrate the painful process of adaptation. They recognize that the most profound satisfaction comes not from easy victories but from overcoming genuine resistance.


The most powerful gaming moments aren't the easy victories. They're the clutch plays against worthy opponents. The adaptations that turn previous defeats into new victories. The discoveries about yourself that only come from honest competition.


Those who fear the mirror will never see themselves clearly. Those who avoid worthy opponents will never know their true capacity. The question isn't whether SBMM makes games betterâ€”it's whether we have the courage to face our equals and grow from what we find there.
