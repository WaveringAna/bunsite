Yesterday my friend called me a freak. Not in the reclaimed way, not as a badge of honor between faggots who know what it means to be called worse. They meant it. Disgust dripping from every syllable because I write fictional incest of sisters loving each other, and they think that makes me morally bankrupt. This friend is trans, gay, furry. Has spent years explaining to family why their identity isn't a mental illness, why their community isn't inherently sexual, why disgust isn't a moral argument. But apparently none of that applies when the content triggers their personal revulsion.

I'm watching this pattern everywhere online. Progressives who have done the intellectual work to dismantle conservative moral reasoning when it targets them suddenly rediscover its utility when encountering something that makes them uncomfortable. The same emotional architecture, different targets. The mechanism is always identical. Disgust hits first, rationalization follows. Haidt documented this decades ago but somehow it only applies to other people's moral reasoning, never our own. My friend felt visceral revulsion at fictional content and their brain immediately started constructing reasons why this must be morally wrong. Not because of evidence of harm, not because of principled analysis, but because the feeling was so strong it had to mean something.

This is exactly how homophobia works. How transphobia works. How every moral panic in history has functioned. The emotional response comes first, the justification gets built around it. "This disgusts me, therefore it must be wrong, therefore anyone who doesn't see that is morally deficient." The conservative who calls gay people degenerate and the progressive who calls someone a freak for fictional content are using identical psychological processes.

I keep thinking about the language. "Sick." "Twisted." "Degenerate." "Freak." The exact words that have been weaponized against queer communities for centuries, now deployed with surgical precision against fictional taboos and consensual kink. These progressives haven't transcended conservative moral frameworks, they've internalized them. Same purity culture, updated targets.

The philosophical inconsistency is staggering. Mill's harm principle becomes optional the moment personal disgust activates. People who demand concrete evidence of harm when defending their own identities abandon that standard entirely when attacking others. They understand that "this is unnatural" isn't an argument when applied to being trans, but somehow "this is sick" becomes valid when applied to fictional content.

Every attack legitimizes the framework they claim to oppose. When a marginalized person uses disgust-based reasoning against another marginalized person, they validate the logical structure that oppresses them. They're essentially arguing that revulsion can be a legitimate moral foundation, they just disagree about application. Conservative opponents don't need to defeat progressive principles when progressives abandon them voluntarily.

The fiction distinction becomes particularly revealing. These same people defend violent video games, horror films, murder mysteries. They understand that fictional representation of harmful acts isn't equivalent to endorsement of real harm. Until the content hits their personal disgust triggers, then suddenly correlation becomes causation and fictional depictions become moral corruptions.

I've seen people argue that writing about fictional incest somehow causes real child abuse while simultaneously defending their right to write about fictional murder without being accused of promoting real violence. The cognitive dissonance is breathtaking, but disgust makes people stupid. It overrides critical thinking, turns smart people into moral panic participants.

This isn't random hypocrisy. It reveals something fundamental about how moral reasoning actually works in progressive spaces. Not the principled harm-based analysis we claim to use, but the same emotional reasoning that drives conservative moral panics. Visceral disgust dressed up as ethical insight.

The test is simple: do your moral principles remain consistent when confronting content you personally find repugnant? If they collapse the moment your disgust response activates, then they weren't principles. They were preferences with academic footnotes.

What we end up with is predictable. Conservatives with different targets. People throwing stones from glass houses while remaining blind to the contradiction. The same reactionary framework with progressive branding. My friend calls me a freak while wondering why conservatives won't accept their identity. The irony would be funny if it weren't so damaging.

And by the way, there's nothing inherently wrong behind an incesteous relationship, and any if, ands, and buts you come up with almost definitely already violate basic theories of consent (informed consent, capacity, voluntariness, ongoing consent, ability to withdraw), and thus are already wrong and harmful on their own. Between adults with equal power, full capacity, and genuine freedom to exit, the fact that they're related doesn't create additional ethical problems beyond what consent theory already covers.
